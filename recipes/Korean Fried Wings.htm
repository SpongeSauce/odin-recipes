<p>It took about two decades for this style of Korean fried chicken to make its way 
    into the American foodie scene. The chicken is deep fried twice to make the exterior extra crispy and to lock moisture in. The gochujang sauce is a hot, honey, spicy mix...and well, it's just fabulous. 
    You'll have the family completely raving!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place an oven-safe wire rack over the foil.</li>
        <li>Toss chicken wings with vegetable oil, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until evenly coated. Add cornstarch and mix until wings are coated.</li>
        <li>Place wings on the prepared rack.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn wings and bake until no longer pink at the bone and the
             juices run clear, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Whisk water and 1 cup cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Add flour and mix until well combined. Add chicken wings and toss until coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry wings in batches until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Combine gochujang, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl. Add to the saucepan and whisk until sauce thickens, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Toss fried wings in the sauce until coated. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
